# SSH

2 ways to authenticate
	1. Username and password
	2. SSh Key pair 
			Key pair  = public key + private key

Private Key = Secret key. Is stored securely on the client machine
Public Key = Public. Can be shared, e.g. with the remote server


-   SSH service always runs on port 22 of the server

### Creating a ssh key pair

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

- adding public key to the authorized keys 
- in the authorized_key in the .ssh/authorized_keys paste the key in the id_rsa.pub
